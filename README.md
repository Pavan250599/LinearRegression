# LinearRegression

One of the organizations is looking to predict the car price based on the various features of the car.  Based on the features of the car, this company will decide the car price and quote to the customers who are looking to sell the car. In this business problem, you are looking to apply the linear regression technique to create the model and help company take care of the future customers.
 
Project Tasks
Pre-processing the data.
Missing Value Treatment 
Outlier Treatment if required 
Feature Scaling 
Encoding or any other technique to make categorial to Numerical data
Do extensive exploratory data analysis before creating the model.
Write the detailed conclusions from the analysis. 
Identify the variables you think are the most important ones.
Splitting the dataset into train and test sets (if required).
Apply the algorithm which you have learnt, i.e., Linear Regression.
Check if the assumptions of the linear regression are meeting or not.
Remove the unwanted feature from the model by seeing the P-Value. 
At the end, write the detailed analysis and the behavior you saw from the experiments. 

Finding the best performing model using the R Squared, Adjusted R Squared, F-Test, Mean Squared error (MSE), Root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
